## How to spin up your own version 101

0) make sure you have Node.js installed on your system (I used node v18.7.0 & npm 8.18.0)
1) fork the repo
2) navigate to your project folder ```cd your-repo-name```
3) change ```"homepage": "https://asats21.github.io/rare-stats",``` to ```"homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name",```
4) run ```npm install```
5) run ```npm start``` to see your project locally
6) run ```npm run deploy``` to push your changes to your app on the web

Note: if you encounter any strange errors while running locally or deploying, try running ```export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider```
